# Learm-GatsbyJS & Tailwind CSS

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is used to create fast static websites in React. I would highly recommend learning and using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as it would make your life much easier to create beautiful UI. 

I have provided many examples from their docs and implemented some on my own to make things easier.

### Key Points

-   [Configure](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby) Tailwind css for a Gatsby app.
